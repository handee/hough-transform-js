<h1>Hough Transform in JavaScript</h1>

<p>This is a demo of the Hough transform in JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you write shapes on the left canvas you can see what it looks like in a Hough space on the right.  Try writing parallel lines - Theta should be the same. </p>
<p>When you have sufficient points, the best fit Hough line will be indicated with a red dot in Hough space and a red line in the original drawing.</p>
